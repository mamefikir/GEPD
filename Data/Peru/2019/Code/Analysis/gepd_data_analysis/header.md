## What is the Global Education Policy Dashboard?

<!-- /MDTOC -->
Policymakers in low- and middle-income countries who are working to improve student learning often find themselves flying blind. They see the budget that goes into education and (sometimes) the learning that students come out with, but they lack information on the crucial factors in between— the practices, policies, and politics—that drive those learning outcomes. The new Global Education Policy Dashboard initiative will fill that gap.

The World Bank, with support from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the UK’s Department for International Development, has designed a Global Education Policy Dashboard, which measures the drivers of learning outcomes in basic education around the world. In doing so, it highlight gaps between current practice and  what the evidence suggests would be most effective in promoting learning, and it gives governments a way to set priorities and track progress as they work to close those gaps. This collaboration advances the goals of the Human Capital Project, a global effort to accelerate more and better investments in people for greater equity and economic growth.

## How to use this tool
In the table below, you will find our primary indicators - the practices, policies, and politics - that we think are driving learning outcomes.  For a deeper dive, click on the GEPD Data Explorer tab in the top navigation bar of this page.
